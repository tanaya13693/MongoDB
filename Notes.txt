Chapter 1: Introduction

MongoDB Clusters are running on MongoDB Atlas(Hosted MongoDB as a service platform). It s runnig on Amazon AWS.
MongoDB Compass: GUI client to access MongoDB clusters.

Database has collections and collection has documents.
E.g. city.neighbourhod.doc1 = database.collection.document

*Documents: Scalar Value Types
For documents in collection, MongoDB Compass can show 'schema' that can give better sense of data types, range of values, etc.
Data Types: int32, string, double, date


*MongoDB Documents: Fields with documents as values
document can have a field with documents and so on. i.e. nested documents as the fields.

In MOngoDB, data models are flexible. Not all documents can have same fields. We can add supplimentary datain the form of arrays with values. 

Object and document terms are used interchangeably. 

A document/Object can have geosacial data such as combination of an array and other document. Compass used 3rd party plugin for geographical visualization of geosatial fields in your document. 

MongoDB Filtering:
1. Quality filter: {"tripduration": "600"}  //for exact match
2. Range filter:{"tripduration": {"$gte":600, "$lt":1200}}  //for match between range of values
